# Art Snap CS-Principles
This is my fourth Snap! project for CS Principles. This one makes randomly drawn abstract rainbow art.

#### How I Made it
This was a teacher guided project like my first one, so I didn't have much of a hand in coming up with my own solutions. I did make the colors pastel though, and I made mine more jittery than my teacher's was by increasing the randomized rotation amounts.

#### How to Run it
If you see this and you'd like to view my project (it's a very basic project) follow these steps:
1. Download the "Art Creator (CS Principles).xml" file in this repository.
2. Go to https://snap.berkeley.edu/
3. Press the Run Snap! Now button.

4. You can either drag the file onto the Snap window or you can import it, up to you. Follow the steps below to import it. If not, skip to step 8.
5. In the top left of the screen hit the small file icon.
